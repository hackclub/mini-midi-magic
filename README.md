 - [ ] A Complete `BOM.csv` file with all costs for your keyboard in USD (optionally in your local currency). Include the parts in the kit as well, for anyone else who wants to recreate the project!
 - [ ] Document your design process in `journal.md`! Make sure to do this while designing. Each journal entry should have a screenshot or picture of your work, and the time you spent on that section.
 - [ ] Have your PCB, CAD (.step and other files) and Firmware files in their respective folders.
